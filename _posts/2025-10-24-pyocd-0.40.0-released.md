excerpt: "Introducing support for multiple concurrent GDB client connections to the same GDB server."
---

Version 0.40.0 of pyOCD has been released and is available from PyPI. This release includes a number of improvements,
bug fixes and some smaller changes. The complete list is shown below.

To upgrade pyOCD, just run `pip`:

```
pip install --upgrade pyocd
```

This release introduces significant improvements and stability fixes across debugging, reset management,
and flashing workflows. The GDB server now supports multiple concurrent client connections with enhanced
logging and accurate target architecture reporting, while Cortex-M coverage expands with additional secure
and non-secure core registers. Reset management has been streamlined with a clearer API, improved debug
sequence error handling, and support for custom CMSIS-Pack reset sequences. Flashing operations are more
reliable through optimized reset handling and a clean hardware reset after programming.

Thanks again to all the contributors who helped make this release possible! ❤️

## Improvements
- GDB Server:
  - Add support for multiple concurrent GDB client connections to the same GDB server
  - Improve logging with support for multiple concurrent GDB clients
  - Report correct target architecture and align registers with GDB feature names
- Cortex-M:
  - Add missing secure/non-secure core registers (CONTROL, FAULTMASK, BASEPRI, and PRIMASK)
- Reset Management:
  - Update ResetType API for clearer reset handling
  - Remove reset fallback mechanism for CMSIS-Pack based targets to prevent unintended behavior
  - Support custom reset sequence execution defined in CMSIS-Pack
  - Refine debug sequence error handling and breakpoint management across resets
- Load (Flashing):
  - Remove implicit resets between loading multiple application files
  - Set Reset Catch on all cores when performing primary-core reset before flashing
  - Perform a hardware reset (nSRST) after flashing to ensure a clean post-load state
- [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management) integration:
  - Add CMSIS-Pack related commands to `commander` interface

## Fixes
- ST-Link: correct reported length on memory read/write failures
- JLink: block unsupported memory access commands
- CMSIS-DAP: fix `jtag_sequence` returning no data (@NorbertHipfl)
- SWO: correct thread exit flag handling in the SWO read thread (@crypto-lars)
- Fix caching of banked SP registers to prevent stale values
- Fix memory region filtering for multi-core targets
- RTOS: handling for banked PSP registers
- RTX5:
  - Fix incorrect thread priority offset
  - Relax requirement for target in halted state in RTOS operations

## Other
