Version 0.42.0 of pyOCD has been released and is available from PyPI. This release introduces a new subcommand,
a number of improvements and bug fixes. The complete list is shown below.

To upgrade pyOCD, just run `pip`:

```
pip install --upgrade pyocd
```

The latest pyOCD release focuses on strengthening automation workflows, led by the introduction of the new
`run` subcommand. This command enables time-limited or EOT-terminated execution, making it well suited for
CI/CD environments that require deterministic behavior. It provides unified access to semihosting and SWV
streams, offering consistent console output and optional input handling during automated runs.

A new standard I/O routing layer refines how output is managed across cores. The framework consolidates
routing logic and supports console, telnet, file, and disabled modes, creating a uniform mechanism that
simplifies multi-core scenarios.

Integration with [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management)
has also been strengthened. Configuration from `*.cbuild-run.yml` files now occupies a lower priority tier,
sitting beneath command-line arguments and general session options to preserve explicit user intent.

Additional improvements include new flash programming options, relaxed flash algorithm requirements,
updated Zephyr RTOS thread state definitions, and expanded architecture support - most notably
Cortex-M52 and Star-MC3 devices.

Thanks again to all the contributors who helped make this release possible! ❤️

## New Features
- `run` subcommand:
  - Introduce a new `run` subcommand capable of running targets until a time limit or EOT (suited for CI/CD workflows)
  - Supports semihosting console output/input and SWV output

## Improvements
- Standard I/O routing:
  - Add new abstraction layer to unify STDIO routing for each core
  - Routing support for `console`, `telnet`, `file` and `off`
>Note: Currently only output is supported
- [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management) integration:
  - Add configuration layer in session options, which sits below command line arguments
  - Disable `*.cbuild-run.yml` processing if the `target_override` option is set
  - Improve port assignment logic for multi-core GDBServer and telnet configurations
  - Add processing for `connect` mode configuration
  - Add processing for `pre-reset` and `post-reset` options in `load-setup` configuration
  - Improve error messages for missing or invalid `*.cbuild-run.yml` file
  - Improve checking for required files
    - Raise a warning instead of an error for missing SVD files
    - Load SVD files only when available and when used by the subcommand
- Flash programming:
  - Add new session options for configuring `pre-reset` and `post-reset` type in `load` subcommand
  - Relax flash algorithm requirement to require only RO section
- RTOS:
  - Update Zephyr thread state definitions to match modern versions (@mathieuchopstm)
- CoreSight and Cortex-M:
  - Add support for Cortex-M52 and Star-MC3 based devices (@Liu-Gu)
  - Skip adding cores not described in the debug topology while retaining direct AP access

## Fixes
- Cortex-M:
  - Fix incorrect reset type used in the fallback mechanism when the requested DebugSequence doesn't exist
- CMSIS-DAP:
  - Fix HID report sizing logic across platforms
- CMSIS-Packs:
  - Correct path normalization inside pack archives to support `..` in file paths (@xoriath)

## Other
- Minor documentation updates related to session option usage
