Version 0.37.0 of pyOCD has just been released and is available from PyPI. It's been several months since a feature
release, and this one includes a major new addition. Some smaller changes and bug fixes have also been
included in this release. The complete list is shown below.

To upgrade pyOCD, just run `pip`:

```
pip install --upgrade pyocd
```

This release marks a significant milestone by introducing a built-in support for [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management),
enabling a standardized, YAML-driven workflow for specifying debug targets. By passing the new `--cbuild-run`
command-line option followed by the path to a `*.cbuild-run.yml` file, the following is imported directly into the
active debug session:
- target selection,
- flash algorithms,
- memory layout description,
- device debug topology,
- debug sequences

Because each YAML file fully describes a single target type, explicit use of `--target` is no longer required.
This implementation integrates seamlessly with [Arm CMSIS Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.vscode-cmsis-debugger)
extension for VS Code, streamlining end-to-end debug setup for CMSIS-Pack based projects.

Thanks again to all the contributors who helped make this release possible! ❤️

## Important note
With this release, Python 3.7 is no longer supported. The minimum Python version is now 3.8.0.

## Improvements
- [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management) integration:
    - add a `--cbuild-run` option across subcommands
    - select target based on `cbuild-run`
    - debugger-clock setting from `cbuild-run`
    - default memory map
    - primary-core and GDB server port selection based on `cbuild-run`
- GDB server:
    - add option for stetting soft breakpoints as hard
    - add option for resetting and running the target without halting
    - stricter `qC` command handling (@tlyu)
- Coresight:
    - add `apid` handling
    - add AP CSW register SPROT bit handling
    - fix offset for APv2 in discovery step
- Loader: generate reset when loading to RAM
- RTOS: add hint for Zephyr’s thread info configuration
- RTT: allow no down-channels (@laurensmiers)
- Debug sequence: increase robustness
- Memory map: add `pname` based filtering
- Probe: filter out Cypress KitProg3 bridge

## Fixes
- Fix progress bar reprinting the same value when no progress is made
- Typing: fix typing of chip_erase from bool to str (@NilsIrl)
- pytest: use assert_not_called instead of not_called
- target: disable reads of erased sectors if Verify function is provided in the algorithm
- flash:
    - disable builder double buffering by default
    - write XPSR register on init on Cortex-M devices

## Targets
- Add MPS2 AN521 target
- Add Ambiq Apollo3 target and NM180410 board (@joshua-nmi)
- Add RP2350 target (@konkers)

- Update HC32F448/45x/460/4A0(2) targets (@wuze)
- Fix sector size and RDP check on STM32H743 and H723 (@nattgris)

## Other
- Docs:
    - fix incorrect documentation for default GDB server port (@FredeHoey)
    - document `cbuild-run` support
    - enhance load subcommand guidance
- CI:
    - drop Python 3.7 and add 3.12 and 3.13
    - update upload-artifact following deprecation
    - update CodeQL workflow
    - add workflow for generating standalone binaries using PyInstaller
